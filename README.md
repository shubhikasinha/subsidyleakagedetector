# JanAvlokan (जनावलोकन)

**AI-Powered Subsidy Leakage Detection & Monitoring Platform**

---

## Overview

JanAvlokan is a cloud-native, privacy-first decision-support platform designed to proactively identify potential leakages in large-scale government welfare schemes. It uses unsupervised machine learning, policy-aware risk calibration, and explainable analytics to help administrators prioritize audits early—without disrupting legitimate beneficiaries.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization:** Recharts, Leaflet (District Heatmaps)
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes
- **Database:** Google BigQuery (analytical core)
- **AI/ML:** Google Gemini AI for audit explanations
- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## System Architecture

JanAvlokan follows a scalable, modular pipeline built on Google Cloud Platform:

- **BigQuery** serves as the analytical core, storing anonymized transaction data partitioned by date and clustered by scheme and region, enabling analysis at 100M+ transaction scale.
- **SQL-based feature engineering** derives behavioral signals such as rolling claim frequency, deviation from historical averages, cross-scheme overlaps, temporal spikes, and privacy-safe collusion indicators using hashed identifiers.

---

## Machine Learning & Intelligence Layer

The platform uses unsupervised anomaly detection to model normal beneficiary behavior without relying on labeled fraud data.

Each transaction or beneficiary receives:
- A normalized risk score (0-1)
- Risk classification based on scheme-specific thresholds
- Feature-level contributions for explainability

Models are periodically retrained to adapt to policy, seasonal, and regional changes.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Anomaly Detection** | Unsupervised learning to identify deviations without pre-labeled fraud data |
| **Privacy-Safe Detection** | Detect coordinated misuse using hashed identifiers while preserving privacy |
| **Policy-Aware Calibration** | Dynamic thresholds that adapt to scheme type, region, and seasonal variations |
| **Explainable Insights** | Human-readable explanations for every flagged case for audit defensibility |
| **District Heatmaps** | Geographic visualization of risk concentration across districts |
| **Automated Alerts** | Email notifications for high-risk patterns requiring immediate attention |

---

## Dashboard Capabilities

- Ranked high-risk beneficiaries with risk scores
- Clear, AI-generated risk explanations
- Cross-scheme and temporal pattern analysis
- District/block-level risk heatmaps for targeted audits
- Time-series visualization of transaction anomalies
- Audit trail and export functionality

---

## Privacy & Ethics

- No PII is stored or transmitted
- All sensitive identifiers are irreversibly hashed
- Location data is aggregated at district/block level
- The system is strictly advisory—humans always remain in control
- Zero subsidies are blocked or denied; only flagged for review

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Google Cloud account with BigQuery access
- GCP service account key (gcp-key.json)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rewant-1/JanAvlokan.git
cd JanAvlokan

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Add your GCP key file as gcp-key.json in the root directory

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## Impact

Based on public finance benchmarks, JanAvlokan can potentially detect 10-30% of high-risk leakage cases early, enabling smarter audits, reduced wastage, and increased public trust in welfare systems.

---

## Conclusion

JanAvlokan demonstrates how BigQuery, Gemini AI, and explainable analytics can transform subsidy monitoring from reactive audits into proactive, transparent governance—making it a practical, scalable solution aligned with India's vision of Viksit Bharat.
